## 📖 Overview
Recon V3 is a private, pro-grade reconnaissance framework developed for high-scale bug bounty hunting. It automates the entire attack surface discovery process, utilizing distributed cloud computing to scan massive targets in minutes.

**⚠️ Note:** The source code of this tool is private/proprietary. This repository serves as a documentation and portfolio showcase.

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **Distributed Scanning:** Integrated with **Axiom** to spin up fleet instances for distributed fuzzing and scanning.
*   **Smart Fuzzing:** Context-aware fuzzing (Module 08) that detects backend technologies (IIS, PHP, Java) and adapts extensions dynamically.
*   **Stealth Mode:** Rotates User-Agents and mimics browser headers to bypass WAFs.
*   **Full Pipeline:** 
    1. Subdomain Enumeration
    2. Port Scanning & Probing
    3. Screenshotting
    4. Vulnerability Scanning (Nuclei)
    5. Advanced Fuzzing
